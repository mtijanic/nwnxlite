# nwnxlite
Windows MySQL connector for NWN:EE

# Supported versions

nwnxlite supports only NWN:EE versions up to 8186 (the last 32bit build). At this time nwnxlite does not support the 64bit version of the game. See github.com/nwnxee/unified for NWNX:EE and ways to run it on Windows (Docker and WSL).

# Quick start guide:

- Copy everything from bin/dist/ into the folder where your nwserver.exe resides
- Copy nwnxlite.ini into that folder, and edit the settings
- Add nwnxlite.nss to your module. The API is compatible with the aps_include.nss available for NWN 1.69

## Updating

When a new version of NWN:EE is released, the bin/dist/offests.txt file is updated. Simply overwrite your old version with the new one when you update nwserver.exe

## VC redistributable

The MSVC redistributable is required to run nwnxlite. If not already installed on your machine, you can download it here:  https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2977003/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads

Get the x86 version, even if your machine is 64bit.
